0.  It is the longest word in english dictionary which refers to a lung desease.
1.  Gets the resource usage
2.  There are 16 members available in stuct rusage
3.  Because struct rusage contains so may member of type long and two objects of type timeval, the size of each struct rusage is more than 56 bytes. 
    So, instead of copying each rusage object for each function call, by using reference to the object, we can reduce the amount of memory used significantly 
4.  In for loop, if file is successfully opened to file pointer fp, we read the file character by character using fgetc function.
    While doing so, the condition in for loop checks if the pointer in fp has reached the end of file by comparing the value of character read to a constant EOF.
    In the increment sections, inside for loop, we are reading the next character instead of doing i++ or something.
5.  if we read using fscanf and %s, there might be spaces before or in between words which would not read the whole line completely. 
6.  we declared these parameters as constant so that the parameters so passed in cannot be changed in any way.
7.  I used trie to impletemnt the spellchecker. Inside each node, there is a boolean flag called is_word which checks if the characters that had been read until now forms a word or not.
    Other than that there is a self referencing array of nodes that correspond to the 26 letter of the english alphabet and apostrophe 
8.  2.12 sec
9.  In the for loop, instead of doing strlen in every iteration, i saved the value of the word length in a variable so that the strlen function didn't have to go through the string everytime it was called.
    Other than that i tried to make the program as efficient as possible in the first go.
10. I dont' think it has got any in my opinion.
